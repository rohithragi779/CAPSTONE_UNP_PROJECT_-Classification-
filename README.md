# CAPSTONE_UNP_PROJECT_-Classification-

Completed this project as part of my Data Science and Machine Learning Course with the United Network of Professionals (UNP). Key highlights:

Studied and Analyzed the CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION dataset to apply Machine Learning Models and present my insights.

Performed various Exploratory Data Analyses to understand the data and compare the variables.

Experimented with different Machine Learning Algorithms, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier, Ridge Logistic Regression, K-Means Clusterings 

Classifier, XG Boost Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier.

Compare the results to recommend the best Classification Model.
